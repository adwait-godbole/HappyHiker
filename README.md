# happyhiker
My first web development full stack project.

View Campgrounds across the globe, leave reviews and add your own campgrounds with pictures and reviews. The tech stack used in this project is HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript
for the frontend and Nodejs, Express for the backend. The database used for storing users is MongoDB and for storing static files like campground images I have used Cloudinary.

You can view the working model of this website on https://happyhiker.herokuapp.com
Alternatively you can download the zip file and run 'npm install' to install all the dependencies and run 'nodemon app.js' to start the server.
